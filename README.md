🧱 Tech Stack:
💻 Frontend:
React / Streamlit / HTML + JS (for demo dashboard)

⚙️ Backend:
Python + Flask/FastAPI

🧠 ML Model:
Scikit-learn or TensorFlow (for structured data)

CNNs (for image-based cancer detection like histopathology)

🧠 GenAI:
OpenAI GPT API or open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral via HuggingFace)

LangChain (optional for chaining tools)
